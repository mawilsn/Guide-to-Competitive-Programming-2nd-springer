## 3.1 Time Complexity

What is time complexity?
* It is an algorithm that estimates how time it will take given a certain output


What is the benefit?
* We can find out if the algorithm is fast enough

There is a basic understanding of what we mean by time complexity. What is the notation used?
* "O" is th symbol for the time complexity
* "n" denotes the size of the input
  * if n is an array, the length of the array is the size.
  * if n is a string, it's the lenght of the string

### 3.1.1

What is the time complexitgy of a single comand?
* This is a time complexisty of O(1)
